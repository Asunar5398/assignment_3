TASK 1
# Factorial Program in Python

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This Python program calculates the factorial of a number using an **iterative function**.  
It demonstrates the use of:
- Functions in Python
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Basic error handling

---

## ðŸ§® What is Factorial?
The **factorial** of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

\[
n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times ... \times 1
\]

For example:
- `5! = 5 Ã— 4 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1 = 120`
- `0! = 1` (by definition)



TASK 2
# Math Operations Program in Python

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This Python program demonstrates the use of Pythonâ€™s built-in **`math` module**.  
It allows the user to enter a number and then calculates:

- The **square root** of the number  
- The **natural logarithm** (log base *e*)  
- The **sine** of the number (in radians)
